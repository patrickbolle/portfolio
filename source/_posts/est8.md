## <a href="https://www.est8.io">EST8.io</a>
was my capstone project for graduating Conestoga College this year.
In our senior year, finishing off the Computer Programmer/Analyst program at Conestoga, we were required to build a project with a client over the course of 4 months.
My group was accepted by a local real estate agent who was hoping to make a 'easy to use, all in one' real estate listing site. As inexperienced programmers, new to the working world, my group was extremely excited to work alongside a real life client, meeting with him weekly and giving him progress reports almost daily.

### Technology
Our client wanted to bring all of the exciting features of the web into the real estate market, as he said that the real estate technology market is lagging behind the tech world.
Through our schooling in college, we mostly learned the basics of web development, delving into web applications with PHP, Java Web, and ASP.NET. Although we were encouraged to build our capstone project with these technologies, my group looked beyond them, hoping to learn something new and exciting during this semester.
Over the Christmas break I looked into learning some Javascript frameworks, which all the internet buzz has been about for the past couple of years.
Glazing over hundreds and hundreds of frameworks, I finally stumbled upon <a href="www.meteor.com">Meteor JS</a>, which sounded like a great first step into the Javascript world.

Meteor allowed us to throw up a fantastic MVP in only a couple of months. Using Meteor impressed our client, professors, and judges at the Capstone Project Competition (which we won). It opened up a whole new realm of web development to us, one that was fun and exciting to code in - as opposed to using Java Web or ASP.net which just seemed like such a slow and bogged down process.

### What Is It?
Essentially EST8.io is our way of bringing in all of the cool state of the art web features into the real estate world.
We were able to bring in some exciting features that the local real estate websites don't have, like :
- Live chat between home-buyers and real estate agents
  - This allows for instant contact with an agent to book a viewing, or just get extra info regarding the house/property.
- Agent profiles with CRUD, drag and drop calendars for agent's to show their open house times, etc.
- Stripe Checkout integrated for monthly listing payments
  - Stripe's easy to use API and incredible documentation made this a really easy process
- <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a> for our HTTPS certificate. Free, easy and trusted certificates.

### Overview

This capstone was a fantastic introduction to working alongside clients, something I hope to be doing a lot of this summer while freelancing.

After building this project using Meteor, my group was exposed to the new side of web development, opening our eyes to a more productive side of programming. Although the internet is still sketchy about Meteor, it provided us with an easy way to get a web app built in a short period of time. I will continue using Meteor, most likely using it with React in the future - and I'm really excited about MDG's new <a href="http://www.apollostack.com/">Apollo Stack</a> which will give Meteor a leading edge in the JS world.
