is a property management web app, meant for property managers to organize their tenants, properties and owners in one easy place.
My company was looking for an easier way to organize their mass amount of information, and our combination of pen and paper, Dropbox, and spreadsheets was getting a little out of hand. 

I built SL Systems using PHP + MySQL, hosted on multiple Digital Ocean droplets based in NYC.
